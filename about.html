    <center><h3>A Memoir of a Life Well-Lived: The Journey of Duke P. Dahal</h3></center>
    <h6>November, 2024</h6>
    
    <p>I was born near the rugged and picturesque landscape of Boulder, Colorado—a place where the mountains kiss the
sky and life always seems to breathe a little more deeply. My story, though, doesn’t begin with the grandeur of 
those mountains or the quiet beauty of Colorado’s wilderness. It begins with a meeting that would change my life
forever: the day I met my dad. I was just two years old, wide-eyed and unknowing. He saw me; I saw him. And in 
that moment, something unspoken passed between us. You could call it love at first sight. At least, I think it was 
love at first sight—though the memory is hazy, tucked away in the distant recesses of a young life. </p>

<p>What I do remember is this: we hit it off, and we hit it off fast. He took me on grand adventures, introducing me 
to the joys of hiking and the thrill of sightseeing. The way he looked at the world made it seem bigger, brighter, 
more filled with possibility. But perhaps his most profound gift to me was introducing me to a universe of flavors. 
<span>Oh, the snacks—each one a tiny revelation!</span> From savory treats to sweet indulgences, every bite was a new chapter in 
the story of our bond. Together, we forged a companionship that was as unshakable as the mountains themselves.</p>

<p>For five years, it was just the two of us, partners in exploration and indulgence. Then, as life often does, 
things changed. He met someone. A woman who would become his partner and, by extension, mine. To her, he was a 
soulmate; to me, she was a source of opportunity. I quickly realized she could be easily manipulated for food. 
She insisted on me earning it—sometimes by enduring ridiculous costumes or sitting patiently through her whims—
but what wouldn’t I do for the promise of chicken? Our relationship was unconventional, but it worked. Over time, 
she became part of my pack, and I hers.</p>

<p>Now, at 13 years old, I find myself in the golden years of life. My priorities have shifted. The frenetic energy 
of youth has mellowed into a fondness for stillness. I’ve learned the art of napping by the window, where the light 
filters in just so, wrapping me in a cocoon of warmth. It is there that I find peace, far from the noisy chaos of 
children and the unbridled energy of puppies. I love them in theory, of course. But in practice? They’re best enjoyed 
from a distance.</p>

<p>Aside from my parents, there’s only one other soul I hold dear: Lamby. A companion unlike any other, Lamby doesn’t 
speak,doesn’t move, and, most importantly, doesn’t interrupt my peace. His constant presence has been a comfort, a 
quiet reminder that some friendships are built on simply being there. If you’re curious, Lamby is a plush toy—a 
humble lamb who has seen me through countless days and quiet afternoons.

<p>As I reflect on the years, I can’t help but feel gratitude for the life I’ve lived. It’s been filled with love, 
adventure, and more than a few meals shared with those I hold dear. The perfect afternoon for me now is a simple 
one: a nap, a treat, and the knowledge that I am loved. And in the end, isn’t that what we all want?</p>
